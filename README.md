# Crypto Application Documentation

## Overview
This crypto application is designed to provide real-time information about various cryptocurrencies. It offers features such as fetching coins with a completion handler, async/await concurrency, caching data, dependency injection, unit testing, pagination, and loading images.

## Features
### Fetching Coins with Completion Handler
- The application fetches cryptocurrency data from an external API using a completion handler, ensuring real-time updates on coin prices and other relevant information.

### Async/Await Concurrency
- Utilizing async/await concurrency, the application ensures smooth performance and responsiveness by handling asynchronous operations efficiently.

### Caching Data
- The application implements data caching to store previously fetched cryptocurrency data locally, reducing network requests and improving user experience.

### Dependency Injection
- Dependency injection is employed to manage object dependencies and facilitate loose coupling between components, enhancing the application's maintainability and testability.

### Unit Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests are included to verify the functionality of individual components, ensuring robustness and reliability across different scenarios.

### Pagination
- The application supports pagination to efficiently handle large datasets of cryptocurrency information, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of data seamlessly.

### Loading Images
- Images associated with cryptocurrencies are loaded asynchronously, providing visual representations of coins within the application interface and enhancing the user experience.
